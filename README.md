Anaximander the Grid Cartographer is a map tile generator for [InWorldz][] and [OpenSimulator][] servers using compiled D and the [ImageMagick][] library, utilizing parallel processing and advanced tree data structures to generate only what is needed in as short a time as possible.

For installation and building instructions, please see the [Anaximander wiki][wiki].

For the history buffs: [Anaximander][] was an early Greek scholar and philosopher who is credited as being one of, if not the, first to draw a map of the world.

For Apple OS lovers: while I use a Mac myself, this program was developed because the original PHP scripts were not only very slow, but they were Linux-only and I had a need for a version that would run under Windows Server.  This kills two birds with one stone, but the third got away because I wasn't aiming for him!
